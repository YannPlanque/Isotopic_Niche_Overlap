# Isotopic Niche Overlap : considering both intra- and interindividual variability in the identification of isotopic niches with standard ellipses
• **OBJECTIVES** : 
<br>1) Identify isotopic niches at species level with isotopic data including both intra- and interindividual variability (e.g. of study cases: serveral isotopic values measured along seal whiskers, bird feathers, tooth growth layers).</br>
<br>2) Measure <ins>isotopic niche overlap</ins> between species.</br>

• **METHOD** : estimate **isotopic standard ellipses** with a **novel hierarchical model developed in a Bayesian framework** to consider **two levels of isotopic variability**: an **intra-individual level** (characterised by several isotopic measurements for each individual, e.g. along a whisker) and an **interindividual** one. Our model therefore expanded on standard model with one level of isotopic variability (an interindividual one; *cf*. [Jackson et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2011.01806.x)).

• **LANGUAGE** : R (version 4.0.2). Model implemented in software Stan (package rstan, version 2.21.0).

• **CASE STUDY** : isotopic niche overlap was quantified here using δ13C and δ15N isotopic values from whiskers of 18 harbour and grey seals.
