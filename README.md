# Isotopic_Niche_Overlap
Identification of isotopic niches of different species, and of interspecific isotopic overlap.
Isotopic niches are quantified with a hierarchical model developed in a Bayesian framework.
The model included in this script is adapted to data with intra-individual variability in isotopic composition (here, stable isotopes analyses at the level of seal whisker segments).

This script was developped as part of the article "Trophic niche overlap between sympatric harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) and grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) at their Southern European limit range (Eastern English Channel)" by Yann Planque, Jérôme Spitz, Matthieu Authier, Cécile Vincent and Florence Caurant, submitted in Ecology & Evolution journal.

Data used in this script are freely available on SEANOE:
Planque Yann, Vincent Cécile, Guillou Gaël, Lebreton Benoit, Caurant Florence (2020). δ13C and δ15N stable isotope compositions of the whisker of 8 harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) and 10 grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) captured in the baie de Somme, France, in 2008 and 2012, for telemetry tracking.

Before running the script, please download the file repository in the ZIP file and place it on your desktop. Place the data previously dowloaded in the subfile "Input".
