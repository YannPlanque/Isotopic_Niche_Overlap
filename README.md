### Isotopic Niche Overlap : considering both intra- and interindividual variability in the identification of isotopic niches with standard ellipses
>> OBJECTIVES : 1) identification of isotopic niches at species level with isotopic data including both intra- and interindividual variability (e.g. of study cases: serveral isotopic values measured along seal whiskers, bird feathers, tooth growth layers). 2) measure isotopic niche overlap between species.
>> METHOD : estimate isotopic standard ellipses with a novel hierarchical model developed in a Bayesian framework to consider two levels of isotopic variability: an intra-individual level (characterised by several isotopic measurements for each individual, e.g. along a whisker) and an interindividual one. Our model therefore expanded on standard model with one level of isotopic variability (an interindividual one; cf. Jackson et al., 2011).
>> LANGUAGE : R (version 4.0.2). Model implemented in software Stan (package rstan, version 2.21.0).
>> CASE STUDY : isotopic niche overlap was quantified here using δ13C and δ15N isotopic values from whiskers of 18 harbour and grey seals.
